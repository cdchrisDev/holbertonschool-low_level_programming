## C Static Libraries
As our programs get larger and complex is necesary to delegate pieces of code to more smaller components to work with. It is better to manipulate tiny and lighter pieces than manipulate a big and havier

**What is a "C" Library? What is good for?**\
Are just collections of objects files that are linked only during the linking phase of compilation, and are not relevant during runtime. (just the executable is needed)

In the compilation time both are either linked into the program or one of its share libraries. However, the object files from the dynamic library are not inserted into the executable file. Instead, when the program is started, a program in the system `dynamic loader` checks out which shared libraries were linked with the program, loads them to memory and attaches them to the copy of the program in memory\
But, if we re-compile  the dynamic library and try to run a second copy of our program with the new library, we'll soon get stuck - `dynamic library` soon will find the copy of the library is already stored in memory, and thus will attach it to our program, and not load the new (modified) version from the disk\

**Creating A Static "C" Library Using "ar" and "ranlib"**\
`ar` for `archiver` Create **Static Libraries** *which are actually archive files*\
\
-> `ar rc libutil.a util_file.o util_net.o util_math.o`\
\
This command creates a static library named `libutil.a` and puts copies of the object files `util_file.o`, `util_net.o` and `util_math.o` in it. If the library file already exists, it has the object files added to it, or replaced, if they are newer than those inside the library. The `c` flag tells ar to create the library if it doesn't already exist. The `r` flag tells it to replace older object files in the library, with the new object files.\
\
\
**After a archive is created or modified.** There is a need to *index* it. This *index* is latter used by the compiler to speed up symbol-lookup inside the library, and make sure that the order of the symbols in the library won't matter during compilation\
\
-> `ranlib lilbutil.a`\
\
**Note:** when an archive file's index generation date (stored inside the archive file) is older than the file's last modification date (stored in the file system), a compiler trying to use this library will complain its index is out of date, and abort. There are two ways to overcome the problem:\

* -> Use `ranlib` to re-generate the index.\

* When copying the archive file to another location, use `cp -p`, instead of only `cp`. The `-p` flag tells `cp` to keep all attributes of the file, including its access permissions, owner *(if `cp` is invoked by a superuser)* and its last modification date. This will cause the compiler to think the index inside the file is still updated. This method is useful for makefiles that need to copy the library to another directory for some reason.
\

**Using a "C" Library In A Program**\
\
-> `cc main.o -L. -lutil -o prog`\
\
This will create a program using object file `main.o`, and any symbols it requires from the `util` static library. Note that we omitted the `lib` prefix and the `.a` suffix when mentioning the library on the link command. The linker attaches these parts back to the name of the library to create a name of a file to look for. Note also the usage of the `-L` flag - this flag tells the linker that libraries might be found in the given directory (`'.'`, refering to the current directory), in addition to the standard locations where the compiler looks for system libraries.\
